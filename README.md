<h1>MP project3 - Anyone Can Cook! </h1>

<h2>UX</h2>

<h3> Project Goals</h3>



'Anyone Can Cook' is a recipe sharing site inspired by the Disney film 'Ratatouille' and the book from the film 'Anyone Can Cook'. The idea behind the site is to build a library of recipes from user input, from professional to family cooks, to share ideas and help budding cooks and veterans learn and improve.



Using a Disney theming helps the site feel welcoming to everyone, and using a clear structure that isn't over packed with graphics means that someone quickly trying to access the information won't get stuck trying to find what they're looking for, also a user that isn't too comfortable with the internet will still be able to use the site with ease.



<h3> Developer Goals</h3>

My main goals when developing this application were:

<ul><li>To build an easy to access library of recipes </li>
    <li>To allow users to add their own recipes and edit their own recipes</li>
    <li>To allow users or an admin to delete a recipe, given permissions</li>
    <li>Have a clear and accessible UX to help make the site welcoming</li>
